- [ ] The app should ask for location permissions and use current location to position the map
on the city where the user is currently located
- [ ] If the permissions are not granted or the location is outside of working area of any of these
cities, the app should ask the user to select a city manually (cities should be grouped by
country)
- [ ] The main screen of the app should consist of two parts: the map and the information panel
- [ ] The information panel should display additional information found in the city object for a
city that is currently in the middle of the map
- [ ] The user should be able to zoom and pan the map
- [ ] After a certain zoom level (when working areas are too small to see) each city should be
represented by an icon
- [ ] Pressing the city icon should center the map on that city and adjust the zoom level to make
the working area fit the screen
- [ ] The working area should be semi-transparent
